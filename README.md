# PlopGraph

## Intro

A toy tool to create and manipulate graphes in JS. It allows the user to
plop (create) nodes and then move and connect them.

## HowTo

First open index.html in your favourite browser (tested on Firefox 7)

From there you can do

### Node creation

Left-click anywhere on a blank area

### Node deletion

Right-click on a node

### Arc creation

 + Left-click on the node from where the arc should start
 + Now you are in arc-drawing mode !
 + Click on the node you want to connect
 + You can chain from there to anothere node !
 + When you're done left- or right-click anywhere that is not on a node

### Arc Deletion

Same process as for nodes. Right-click on the arc you want to delete

### Arc division

If you left-click on an arc, you will create a node divising this arc in
two.
